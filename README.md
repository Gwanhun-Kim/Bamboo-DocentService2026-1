Bamboo is the photography club of Sejong University in Seoul, South Korea. 
We host photography exhibitions twice a year. 
This project is for our upcoming exhibition in March 2026, themed "The First Time." 
For this specific exhibition, we are proud to introduce our first-ever docent service to enhance the visitor experience.
